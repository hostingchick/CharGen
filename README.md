# CharGen

CharGen is a browser based character sheet generation tool.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and fire it up using `ng serve`. Once the web app has started the tool is ready to
use by navigating to `http://localhost:4200`.

## Supported Game Systems

Currently, the only targeted game system is the 3.5 D20 SRD. Future plans may add in other game engines for character
sheet building.
